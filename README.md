It includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of models to identify factors that influence stroke risk, with the goal of providing early intervention and personalized medical advice based on an individual's characteristics and medical history. This process typically encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment to assist healthcare professionals in assessing stroke risk and taking preventive measures.
